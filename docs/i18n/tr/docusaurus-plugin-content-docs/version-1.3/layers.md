Layers are an option to group elements together. Click on the element to see and change the layer. Use the [layer painter](painters/layer.md) to change the layers of multiple elements.

## The layers dialog

Open the layer dialog by clicking on an empty canvas and clicking on "Layers".

Here you can see all the layers in the project. Remove a layer by clicking on the trash icon or moving to the left or right. Change the visibility of a layer by clicking on the eye icon.
