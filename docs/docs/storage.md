## Web

The application data is stored in your browser. It is stored in a local storage.
Open the developer tools in your browser and you will see the data.

## Native platforms

As default the application saves the data in your documents folder in a subfolder called "Linwood/Butterfly". This folder is created when you save the first data. This folder can be changed in the settings.
