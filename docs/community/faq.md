Here are some frequently asked questions.

## Web

### How do I install the web version?

You can install the web version by clicking on the install button in the title bar.
After that you can use this app offline.

## Desktop

### Stylus input are not recognized

> [#238](https://github.com/LinwoodCloud/Butterfly/issues/238)

I'm using the input provided by the flutter framework.
There are already issues to track it:
Windows: [flutter/flutter#65248](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65248) and [flutter/flutter#102836](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/102836).
Linux: [flutter/flutter#63209](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/63209)

These issues are a bit older. The web version should work fine for now.
