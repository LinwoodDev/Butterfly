It is very easy to host your own butterfly web server.

## Simple server

Install flutter and build the app using:

```bash
cd app
flutter pub get
flutter build web
```

All the files are in the `app/build/web` directory.

## Docker

Clone the repository and build the `Dockerfile` using: `docker build -t linwood-butterfly`.
Start the server using: `docker run -p 8080:80 -d linwood-butterfly`.
