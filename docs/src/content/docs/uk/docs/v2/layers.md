Layers allow you to separate elements from each other and choose which layers are rendered on top of others.

Layers are drawn from bottom to top, so the top layer will be shown above all other layers.

:::note\[Note]

Be aware that [Collections](../tools/collection) are not the same as layers. Collections are a lightweight way to group elements, but do not affect the order in which they are renderered.

## The Layers dialog

Open the layer dialog by clicking on the Butterfly button and selecting Layers, or by selecting the Layers icon in the Navigation Rail if it is enabled.
