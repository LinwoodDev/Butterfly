A pack is a collection of components that can be used in the stamp tool. You can create your own pack or import an existing one. For this click on the top left corner and click on "Packs".

Packs are saved globally, so you can use them in any document. If you want to share the pack in a document, you can bundle it with the document.

Styles are used to customize the appearance of the text. The paragraph styles can be used to format a whole paragraph (like a heading), while the text styles can be used to format only a part of the text (like a bold word).

The color palettes can be used to quickly select colors for the colorable tools. You will see a color picker overlay (like mentioned in the [color picker documentation](/docs/v2/color_picker)) when you edit a color picker.
