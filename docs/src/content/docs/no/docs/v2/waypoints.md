With waypoints, you can save important locations in your notes and quickly navigate between them.

Open the Waypoints dialog by clicking on the Butterfly button and selecting Waypoints, or by selecting the Waypoints icon in the Navigation Rail if it is enabled.

To create a waypoint, move to the position on the canvas where you would like to place the waypoint, open the Waypoints dialog, and select Create. If Scale is checked, the canvas's current zoom amount will be saved in the waypoint, and the canvas will return to that same zoom amount whenever you navigate to the waypoint.

To replace/overwrite an existing waypoint, move to a new position on the canvas, open the Waypoints dialog, and select Replace.

## The Origin waypoint

The Origin waypoint is a special waypoint that defines the default position and scale when a document is opened. To change the default position or zoom, simply select Replace on the Origin waypoint.
