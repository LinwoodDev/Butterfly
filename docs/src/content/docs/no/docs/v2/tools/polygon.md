With this tool you can create custom shapes.

## Usage

1. Click on the canvas to add the first point of the polygon.
2. Click again to add subsequent points.
3. Now you have three options to finish the polygon:
   1. Click in the toolbar on the `Finish` button. This will connect the last point to the first point.
   2. Click in the toolbar on the `Submit` button. This will create the polygon without connecting the last point to the first.
   3. Change the tool. This will also create the polygon without connecting the last point to the first.
4. If you want to remove the selected point, click on the `Delete` button in the toolbar.
5. To edit the last point, click on the `Edit` button in the toolbar. This will allow you to click on a point and drag it to round it off.

## Toolbar

- `Edit`: Allows you to change the selected point of the polygon.
- `Delete`: Allows you to delete the selected point of the polygon.
- `Finish`: Connects the last point to the first point, completing the polygon.
