In Butterfly, templates are a helpful way to make a document a starting point for quick use.

For example, if you like having a highlighter tool and a dotted background when note taking, you can use templates to quickly apply the tools you need and the specific background you like.

## What do templates store?

Templates are basically documents that you use as a starting point.

They store everything a normal document does, including:

- Unelte
- Document Content like pictures, drawings, strokes, etc.
- The settings for each tool
- Straturi
- Domenii
- Pagini

## How to make a template?

Simply make a new note, then after configuring it to your needs, press the Butterfly icon at the top-left then press templates.

Press the "Create" button, and give it a name, keep directory empty unless you want to save the template somewhere specific.

## Where can I find more templates?

Unfortunately, there is no specific place to share your templates.

But if you think you have made a cool template, feel free to share in Discord.
