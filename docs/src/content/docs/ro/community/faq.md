Iată câteva întrebări puse frecvent.

## Web

### Cum instalez versiunea web?

You can install the web version by clicking on the install button in the title bar.
After that you can use this app offline.

### Flutura nu se încarcă pe Brave

Brave Users who have set the 'Block Fingerprinting' Shield setting to Aggressive, need to change it to 'Standard' or just plain 'Block Fingerprinting'.
Click on the shield icon in the address bar to change the setting.
Try updating your browser to the latest version.

## Mobil

### S-Pen won't be recognized

> [#270](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/270)

I'm using the input provided by the flutter framework.
This is the issue to track it: [flutter/flutter#42846](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/42846).

### Butterfly is slow

Butterfly is optimized every update, but sometimes the problem could be from your device.

1. First, turn off your device's power saver mode.
2. Then, set your screen refresh rate to its highest available (if supported by your device)

This allows Butterfly to refresh faster and feel more responsive.

If these steps dont help, please dont hesitate to complain in Discord, Matrix, or in Github.

### Butterfly restarts in the background

Disable battery optimization for Butterfly.  
Battery optimizations prevent apps from running normally in the background to save power.

Samsung, among other brands, usually put heavy battery restrictions on apps that crash frequently or overheat the device.

If you dont know how to disable battery optimization for Butterfly, this website may help: [Dont kill my app!](https://dontkillmyapp.com/)

### iOS support

> [#244](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/244)

Butterfly is available on iOS as preview. Click [here](https://butterfly.linwood.dev/downloads/ios) to download it. See [here](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/244#issuecomment-1935460878) why it's not available on the App Store.

## Birou

### Intrarea stylus nu este recunoscută

> [#238](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/238)

I'm using the input provided by the flutter framework.
There are already issues to track it:
Windows: [flutter/flutter#65248](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65248) and [flutter/flutter#102836](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/102836).
Linux: [flutter/flutter#63209](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/63209)

These issues are a bit older. The web version should work fine for now.
