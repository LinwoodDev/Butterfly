## Web

### How do I install the web version?

### S-Pen won't be recognized

> [#270](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/270)

I'm using the input provided by the flutter framework.
This is the issue to track it: [flutter/flutter#42846](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/42846).

### Butterfly is slow

Butterfly is more performant every update, but sometimes, the problem is your device.

First, turn off your device's powersaver.
Then, set your screen refresh rate to its highest.
This allows butterfly to update faster and become more responsive.

If these steps dont help, please dont hesistate to complain in Discord, Matrix, or in Github!

### Stylus input are not recognized

> [#238](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/238)

I'm using the input provided by the flutter framework.
There are already issues to track it:
Windows: [flutter/flutter#65248](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/65248) and [flutter/flutter#102836](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/102836).
Linux: [flutter/flutter#63209](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/63209)

These issues are a bit older. The web version should work fine for now.
