Pages are a way to organize your notes by allowing separate infinte canvases to be contained in a single document.

:::note

Pages are **not** used to create regions on the infinite canvas. To create canvas regions, use [Areas](../areas).

:::

Use the page navigator to create and manage pages.

To create folders of pages, add a `/` in the name of a page.
