> Welcome to Butterfly, the open-source note app.

Butterfly is a note-taking app that aims for a unified experience across all platforms. It provides a simple UI with powerful customization.

## Getting started

> You can use the sidebar to navigate quickly through this wiki.

To start working on the app, you have two options:

1. [Download](/downloads) the app version that is appropriate for your platform. Butterfly can run on most mobile, desktop, and web platforms.
2. Use the [web version](https://web.butterfly.linwood.dev) if you cannot find your platform or if you don't want to install the app. See [here](storage#web) for information about file storage on the web version.

> Once you open the app, continue reading.

## The Home View

  <TabItem label="Desktop">

```
![Welcome screen](welcome_screen_desktop.png)
The top of the screen holds the update banner, a link to this documentation, and the <Gear className="inline-icon"/> Settings button. Finally, to the right of the <Gear className="inline-icon"/> Settings button, you have a drop-down menu for controlling when the update banner will appear (always/never/on updates).

The Files section is the main area to the left. Here, you can do the following operations:
- Select the display type (<GridFour className="inline-icon"/> Grid or <List className="inline-icon"/> List)
- Select the [source storage](../storage) of the files
- Sort the display order of the files
- Add a folder, file, template, or import files by clicking the <Plus className="inline-icon"/> plus sign
- Switch to a different directory by typing in the <Folder className="inline-icon"/> Location field
- Search for files

Finally, to the right, you have the Quickstart display with the templates available in the current location. For a fresh install, this includes the Light and Dark templates.

## The Document View

```
In the top-left of the screen, you have the file bar:\

This holds, from left to right:

- The <img alt="logo" src={logo.src} className="inline-icon" width="16"/> Butterfly button, which opens the menu.
- The Name field, which displays the name of the note. You can rename the note by typing a new name into the field and saving the note.

To add more tools to the toolbar, click the <Plus className="inline-icon"/> Add button. In the Add menu, you can use the search bar or filters to find the tool you are looking for. For more information, see [Add](add).

To reorder the tools on your toolbar, first select a tool and then click-and-drag it to a new position. Some input methods have shortcuts to quickly switch to tools based on their position on the toolbar, which can be [configured](shortcuts#configure).

Many tools have a configuration menu, which allows you to change settings about how the tool behaves. To open this menu, first select a tool in the toolbar and then click it again.
