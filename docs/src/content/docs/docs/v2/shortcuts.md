## Configure {#configure}

You can customize the controls by giving every control a tool index. The tool indexing starts from the left of the toolbar, with `1` being the first index. See example below

Here, 1 refers to the lasso tool, 2, to the pan tool etc.

The configure options you have are the following:

* Empty - the tool is unchaged.
* 0 - the tool will function as moving (i.e., hand) in this mod.
* Positive number - The tool will follow the indexing as explain above.
