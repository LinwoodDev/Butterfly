:::note[⚡ Action tool]

This is a special tool.
You can't select it and it will run the action if you click on it.

:::

With this tool you can change the collection of multiple objects. Read more about collections [here](../collections.md).
When you click on an object, the collection of the object will be changed to the collection set in the configuration. Leaving the collection field empty will set the collection to the default collection.
